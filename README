A little bit of code was copied and slightly modified from Django itself;
all of it is in templates so any file in */template/ dir is under BSD.

PREREQUISITIES

you will of course need:
- django (>=1.0) [looks like 1.1 works just fine :) ]
- python (>=2.5, <3.0)
- textile (2.1.3 works fine; called python-textile in Fedora)

Textile is the least popular of bunch, so in case you don't find it in repository:

[foo@bar ~]$ sudo easy_install textile

if bash will complain to you, that command is not found then:
1) blame your distribution
2) install package setuptools (some distros may name it python-setuptools)
   if not found again, go to step 1 or...
3) compile it yourself (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile)

DEVELOPMENT

to create database:
[foo@bar zapisy_zosia]$ python manage.py syncdb

to run developer server (port 8000):
[foo@bar zapisy_zosia]$ python manage.py runserver

TRANSLATION

update *.po files, and run
$ django-admin compilemessages
in project's root dir

DEPLOYMENT

1) clear the database, if it exists. It's a matter of a sequence of consecutive
   'DROP TABLE <table name> CASCADE;' in the psql shell.
2) make sure there is no zapisy_zosia directory in the deployment directory.
3) given that you have git installed on the deployment machine, simply type
   $ git clone <repository_url>
   where current repository is http://github.com/dreamer_/zapisy_zosia.git
   If you don't have git installed, you have to checkout the source code and put
   it in the deployment directory some other way.
4) $ python manage.py syncdb
5) Change the text of email messages - that is, the content of the txt files in
   the zapisy_zosia/templates directory.
6) Go to settings.py and change DEBUG variable to False
7) update all dates - change dates in functions in common/helpers.py.
8) Update Apache's (or other web server) configuration so that it runs this
   Django app.
9) If you own a domain that you want to point to this application, configure the
   domain records and update Apache's configuration so that it recognizes the
   redirection.
8) Restart server!

Q: How to change, how much does this Zosia cost (breakfasts/dinners/night) ?
A: look @ function count_payment(user) in registration/views.py

Q: How can I change dates for my zosia deployment? It's not 2010 any more!
A: look @ common/helpers.py but remember, that in final deployment, changing
   these dates needs server restart

Q: Where is my CSS on admin pages?! I just deployed zosia and my admin page
   is unusable!!!
A: Ops! system expects them to be in /static_media/css/ directory, but for
   release deployment this may not work out of the box; try linking
   correct files in filesystem, e.g.:
   base.css -> /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/contrib/admin/media/css/base.css
