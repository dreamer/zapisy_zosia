A little bit of code was copied and slightly modified from Django itself;
all of it is in templates so any file in */template/ dir is under BSD.

PREREQUISITIES

you will of course need:
- django (>=1.0) [looks like 1.1 works just fine :) ]
- python (>=2.5, <3.0)
- textile (2.1.3 works fine; called python-textile in Fedora)

Textile is the least popular of bunch, so in case you don't find it in repository:

[foo@bar ~]$ sudo easy_install textile

if bash will complain to you, that command is not found then:
1) blame your distribution
2) install package setuptools (some distros may name it python-setuptools)
   if not found again, go to step 1 or...
3) compile it yourself

DEVELOPMENT

to create database:
[foo@bar zapisy_zosia]$ python manage.py syncdb

to run developer server (port 8000):
[foo@bar zapisy_zosia]$ python manage.py runserver

TRANSLATION

update *.po files, and run
$ django-admin compilemessages
in project's root dir

DEPLOYMENT
1) go to settings.py and change DEBUG variable to False
2) update registration dates - change final_date in methods in
   registration/helpers.py. Don't forget to restart server after this!

Q: How to change, how much does this Zosia cost (breakfasts/dinners/night) ?
A: look @ function count_payment(user) in registration/views.py
